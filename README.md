### Projects

Recently I've been getting back into designing PCBs.  Check out the SpiritBall repo for a small project I did recently.  This started as a 100 day design challenge and continued as a playground for ESP development.

I've also been learning kubernetes with a focus towards bare-metal and on-premesis deployments.  I'm currently working in the Constellation repo to delploy a virtualized k8s cluster.  This will become a test bed for development adjacent tools which are increasingly deployed in containerized form.
